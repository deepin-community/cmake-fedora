Description: Set of scripts and cmake modules that simplify the release process
 cmake-fedora is designed to relieve you from chores of releasing software by:
 .
   - Keeping the consistency of release information such as version and update
     messages in:
     - Release notes
     - ChangeLog
     - Tags
     - Spec file
     - Fedpkg commit message
     - Bodhi notes
   - Source archive depends on the files to be packed.
   - Run rpmlint and koji scratch build before tag as sanity checks.
   - Easy upload to scp, sftp hosting services sites.
   - Translation targets like gettext and Zanata.
   - Provide license information and templates of CMakeLists.txt, spec files for
    new packages.
 .
 while avoid some pitfalls like all junk files are packed.
